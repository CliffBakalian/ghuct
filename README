# GHUCT

Stands for GitHUb Classrooms Tracker (gh as though)

## Purpose

We are moving to use github classrooms for students to checkout and submit projects (grading is still done on gradescope). 

Github tracks a lot, and I want to know how evasive we can be on tracking student project progress. 

Things I want to know:
  [ ] when did people checkout the project?
  [ ] on average, how many commits were made per project?
  [ ] how long did it take for people to complete project?
  [ ] some uh... other stuff


## Installation

There are two versions: python and go. I find go runs faster (sometimes too fast, I get rate limited sometimes). Regardless of which version you use, you will need to setup a [github access token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token) and get the url of the organization of the repository that holds the classroom repos. 

### Python
You can just run the python version provided you have `python-dotenv` installed (`pip install python-dotenv`), Even then, not really needed if you wanted to hardcode in your github access token and the url.


### Go

I am pretty sure you can just clone and run `go run main.go` given you have [golang](https://go.dev/) installed. Again you will need to install `godotenv` (`go get github.com/joho/godotenv) if you don't want to hardcode or make your own environment variable getters.
